# MVVM ReactiveSwift/ReactiveCocoa Swift Sample App

![Swift 3.1.x](https://img.shields.io/badge/Swift-3.1.x-orange.svg) ![iOS 10.3.x](https://img.shields.io/badge/iOS-10.3.x-orange.svg) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/albsala/RCMVVMSample.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/albsala/RCMVVMSample)

Given the lack of documentation about how to build a real app using ReactiveSwift/ReactiveCocoa, I decided to try them out by myself, putting different pieces together. I found some articles (see References) about very specific and isolated features of the libraries and how to use them to implement the [Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–viewmodel). Nonetheless, I was not only interested in knowing how to use them to comunicate Views and ViewModels, but also how far I could get using reactive programming building an iOS app. I hope it is useful for somebody else.

## Used libraries

* [ReactiveSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveSwift) 2.0 
* [ReactiveCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa) 6.0 ([Pull request](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa/pull/3504))
* [ObjectMapper](https://github.com/Hearst-DD/ObjectMapper) 2.2
* [Moya](https://github.com/Moya/Moya/releases) 9.0
* [Moya-ObjectMapper](https://github.com/ivanbruel/Moya-ObjectMapper) 2.3 ([Pull request](https://github.com/ivanbruel/Moya-ObjectMapper/pull/66))
* [Changeset](https://github.com/osteslag/Changeset) 2.1

## Quick Start
Just clone/download the sample app, open `RCMVVMSample.xcworkspace` and run the RCMVVMSampleView schema. Dependencies are included for simplicity.

Check `RCMVVMSampleView` ViewControllers, `RCMVVMSampleLib` ViewModels and BackendClient, and `RCMVVMSampleLibTests`.

## App functionality

The app shows a UITabBarController with **two UITableViewControllers using two different approaches to refresh data**. One of them uses UITableView.reloadData() and the other uses batch updates (using [Changeset](https://github.com/osteslag/Changeset)), yet both use reactive extensions.

## Workspace and projects
There is a workspace with three projects: 

* `Pods`: Cocoapods project
* `RCMVVMSampleLib`: Model-ViewModels and BackendClient. This is where backend client, business and viewmodels logic goes. It can be shared and tested easier and quicker since it has no host application.
* `RCMVVMSampleView`: View. This is where only view-code goes.

## ReactiveSwift/ReactiveCocoa features used/shown

* Signal and SignalProducer creation, subscription (observation) and extension
* Map, filter, flatten, collect, retry, throttle
* MutableProperties
* Actions and CocoaActions
* Bindings of actions, properties and UI controls
* Error Handling

## Back-end

App uses [Moya](https://github.com/Moya/Moya/releases) and stubs responses (`itemsResponse.json`) so you do not have to worry about the Back-end.

## Testing

You can find some unit test in the `RCMVVMSampleLibTests` target that show how to test methods that use ReactiveSwift. It helped me a lot to understand Signals and SignalProducers. You should check them out even though you are not interested in unit testing.

## TODO

* Check retain cycles
* Some navigation
* RCMVVMSampleView testing
